- Level editor
- Inventions editor
- remove theme from level, they should be separate abstractions
- Turn EndCondition into a general event manager (can also put any afterUpdate events in there) and remove cleanupHandlers from level

## Level ideas

### Balance scales

- have to keep perfect balance
- try something with a triple-beam balance?

### Knock it over

- Knock over some large objects while keeping the smaller ones upright

## floppy wiggly-waggly rope lines

- Would be cool to have a world where your drawings behave like ropes rather than solid bodies
