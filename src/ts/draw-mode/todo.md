## Level ideas

### Balance scales

  - have to keep perfect balance
  - try something with a triple-beam balance?

### Knock it over

  - Knock over some large objects while keeping the smaller ones upright

## floppy wiggly-waggly rope lines
  - Would be cool to have a world where your drawings behave like ropes rather than solid bodies
