## Level ideas

### Balance scales

  - start with scales weighed down, have to knock off weights
  - have to keep perfect balance
  - try something with a triple-beam balance?

## Rod stuck between two angled ramps
  - Have to get it vertical to fall out
  - Kind of like a crane game where you try to make the prize fall down a chute?
